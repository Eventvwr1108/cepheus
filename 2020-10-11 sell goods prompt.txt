Please create a utility for my sci-fi role playing game, to randomly generate a buyer for the goods which the player will bring to a planet to sell. I will describe how this can be done and I'd like you to output an HTML file which includes some JavaScript which will carry out the calculations and display the results. Use CSS to style the page and use only colours from the list of 140 color names supported by all modern browsers.

Step 1 (set up)
In the top panel, the player will be prompted to "Enter the Universal World Profile (UWP) code for the planet where you are selling, and the result of your "Sell" roll (2D6 and add Liaison skill plus DM for INT or SOC, whichever is highest)"
At this point the script should generate the trade codes for the planet (use the code from attached file 2025-10-11-Generate-trade-codes.txt to calculate the applicable trade codes for the planet from the UWP) and display them in the top panel below the information entered by the player, along with the explanation:
Ag = Agricultural | As = Asteroid | Ba = Barren | De = Desert | Fl = Non‑water fluid oceans | Ga = Garden | Hi = High population | Ht = High technology | Ic = Ice‑capped | In = Industrial | Lo = Low population | Lt = Low technology | Na = Non‑agricultural | Ni = Non‑industrial | Po = Poor | Ri = Rich | Wa = Water world | Va = Vacuum

Step 2 (player choices)
The player should now select from three sets of radio buttons:
* Travel code = None or Amber / Red
* Goods are = Legal / Slightly illegal / Highly illegal
* Broker (if available in this system) = None / +1 / +2 / +3 / +4
Please check the availability of brokers as not all options may be available on the chosen planet.
If the first character of the UWP is X, no broker can be found
If the first character of the UWP is D or E, only Broker +1 can be found
If the first character of the UWP is C, D or E, only Broker +1 or Broker +2 can be found
If the first character of the UWP is B, C, D or E, only Broker +1 or Broker +2 or Broker +3 can be found
If the first character of the UWP is A, any of the four brokers can be found

Step 3, refer to the following CSV files which contain the trade code modifiers and apply the highest applicable modifier for the types of goods being sold. 

Step 3.1 There are six types of common goods which the player may wish to sell. This data, in CSV format with first row being headings, shows the six types, the price per ton, and the price modifiers that apply. * Please ensure that all this data is included in the finished code, exactly as shown in the table *
The price modifiers are in the last two columns - with the heading "First Sale DM" and "Second Sale DM". The modifier is a trade code (as calculated above) then a + and then a number which is added to the sell roll if the planet has the trade code shown. Even if both the trade codes are present, only one of the two modifiers - the highest one - is added to the sell roll.

Common goods,Cost,Quantity,First Purchase DM,Second Purchase DM,First Sale DM,Second Sale DM
Basic Consumable Goods,1000,10D,Ag+3,Ga+2,Hi+1,Ri+2
Basic Electronics,25000,10D,Ht+2,In+4,Ni+2,Po+1
Basic Machine Parts,1000,10D,In+3,Ri+2,Na+1,Ni+2

Basic Raw Materials,5000,10D,As+3,Ni+1,In+2,Ri+2
Common Unrefined Ore,2000,10D,As+2,Va+1,In+2,Na+1

Step 3.2 There are many kinds of trade goods. This extra data, also in CSV format with first row being headings, shows the six types, the price per ton, and the price modifiers that apply.  * Please ensure that all this data is included in the finished code, exactly as shown in the table *
The price modifiers are in the last two columns - with the heading "First Sale DM" and "Second Sale DM". The modifier is a trade code (as calculated above) then a + and then a number which is added to the sell roll if the planet has the trade code shown. Even if both the trade codes are present, only one of the two modifiers - the highest one - is added to the sell roll.

Step 4, apply the modifiers for the starport type, broker, the travel code and the legality as shown below - to the 'sell roll' entered by the player:

If a broker +1 is used, sell roll increased by 1
If a broker +2 is used, sell roll increased by 2
If a broker +3 is used, sell roll increased by 3
If a broker +4 is used, sell roll increased by 4

If starport = A, sell roll reduced by 3
If starport = B, sell roll reduced by 2
If starport = C, sell roll reduced by 1
If starport = X, sell roll increased by 1

If travel code = None or Amber, no effect on sell roll
If travel code = Red, sell roll increased by 2

If goods are = Legal, no effect on sell roll
If goods are = Slightly illegal, sell roll increased by 1
If goods are = Highly illegal, sell roll increased by 2

Step 5, calculate the price that the buyer will pay for the player's goods (the sale price) 

The price that the buyer will pay is a certain percentage of (Base cost × tons) and the percentage is found by referring to this table (CSV format), for the row that matches the modified 'sell roll':

sell roll, percentage
2,40
3,50
4,60
5,70
6,80
7,90
8,100
9,110
10,120
11,130
12,140
13,150
14,160
15,180
16,200

Step 6, generate a profile for the buyer (to add colour to the transaction) - a description, a location to which the goods need to be delivered, any special circumstances for the sale - e.g., urgent / out-of-hours delivery needed

Please use the code in attached file 2025-10-11-Generate-merchant.txt for the description of the buyer, and show the buyer profile in a middle panel.

Step 7 - Please show a table in the bottom panel which lists the different goods and allows the player to enter the number of tons of each good that they want to sell. The table should have these columns, in order left to right:
Name of goods, Base cost, Price offered, Profit or loss (per ton), Tons to be sold

Name of goods and Base cost - these come from steps 3.1 and 3.2
Proce offered - comes from step 5
Profit or loss - can be calculated as the difference between the bacse cost and the price offered
Tons to be sold - the player should be able to enter this number (a positive integer)

Step 8 - on the bottom row of the table in the bottom panel, show the total value of the items to be sold but if the player used a broker then deduct the percentage due to the broker from the final price:
If a broker +1 is used, deduct 5% commission
If a broker +2 is used, deduct 10% commission
If a broker +3 is used, deduct 15% commission
If a broker +4 is used, deduct 20% commission

Show the broker's commission underneath the table
