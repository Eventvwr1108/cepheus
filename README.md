# Space trading in a 2D6 sci-fi game

## buying ##
[This page](https://eventvwr1108.github.io/cepheus/tradecombo.html) allows the referee to enter the UWP of the world where the buying takes place, and the broker that the players want to use. Then click on "Generate market" to see what cargoes are available and what they cost. On the right-hand side a manifest is shown with the amount and cost of each item, with commission (if any) and totals.   
Please note that the code is [here](https://github.com/Eventvwr1108/cepheus/blob/main/tradecombo.html). 
The other similar files are just earlier versions I have untidly left lying around

I have very little skill with JavaScript and all the heavy lifting here was done by generative AI. I know some people don't like that so just letting you know.
