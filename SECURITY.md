# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the stuff linked from the [README](https://eventvwr1108.github.io/cepheus/) is supported. Any other files in 
the repo are either old stuff for historical reference purposes or new 
stuff being worked on and not yet ready.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Considering the data being processed I'm fairly relaxed about security. 
If you have any security concerns about any code in this repo then
please [log as an issue](https://github.com/Eventvwr1108/cepheus/issues).

There should be no expectation that issues will be treated as a high priority,
but I will read the issue log and provide updates for as long as this project 
holds my interest.
